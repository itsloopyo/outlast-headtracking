:: Outlast Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-shim.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-shim.cmd. Copy this
:: file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change nothing
:: else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Shim-only: the mod DLL is itself a system-DLL proxy the game loads
:: directly, so there is no framework to install. Any pre-existing DLL of that
:: name is preserved as <name>.backup on first install for uninstall to
:: restore, which is why FRAMEWORK_TYPE is None.

:: A byte sequence every build of this mod's shim carries - the mod's own name
:: in a string literal is the usual choice. It answers "is the DLL already
:: sitting at that name ours?", which is what decides whether that file is the
:: user's original and has to be kept as <name>.backup. Comparing bytes against
:: the build being installed cannot answer it: on an upgrade the installed shim
:: is the previous version, so the bytes differ and the mod's own DLL gets
:: recorded as the user's original.
set "SHIM_MARKER=Outlast Head Tracking"
:: Optional second identity for a companion launcher with different strings.
set "SHIM_MARKER_ALT="
:: Files copied only when they are not already there, so an upgrade keeps
:: whatever the user tuned. Listing an .ini in MOD_DLLS instead puts it through
:: the unconditional copy and the SHIM_MARKER check, which resets every key on
:: every update and then records the tuned file as the game original.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
